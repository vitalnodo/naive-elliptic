# naive-elliptic

This is a naive implementation of elliptic curves in affine (xy) coordinates
for curves in Short Weierstrass and Montgomery form. For the first one there are
secp256k1 and P256 defined and for the second one curve25519 is defined.

Supported operations:
* BasePointGGet
* ECPointGen
* IsOnCurveCheck
* AddECPoints
* DoubleECPoint
* ScalarMult
* ECPointToString
* StringToECPoint
* PrintECPoint
